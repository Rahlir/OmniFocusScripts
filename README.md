# OmniFocus 3 AppleScripts

## About

This repository contains useful scripts for OmniFocus 3. I have also included a
directory with some icons created from the FontAwesome set. I am planning to
update this repository somewhat regularly as I write new scripts I find useful.
Some scripts take inspiration and may be similar to the popular collection by
[Brandon Pittman](https://github.com/brandonpittman/OmniFocus).

## Installation

### Compile Script

I added a compiler script to simplify the installation process. This is the
executable `compile.sh` script. You can just supply the directory with the
script you wish to compile and it will compile it to either the OmniFocus
script folder or the Script Library folder. Note that the `compile.sh` uses the
`com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3` folder, hence, if your script folder is different
(for instance `com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3.MacAppStore`), you need to change the
variable `scriptfolder` in the `compile.sh` file - it is located at the top of
the script.

There is another library specifically for the interaction with the Timing app.
This library is required by the script `Start Task`. To install this library,
just run the script `compile.sh` with the option `-t`.

Make sure to install the `Library` script first - this library is used by most
of the other scripts.

**Example Usage (from the OmniFocusScripts folder):**

To compile the library:
```bash
./compile.sh Library
```

To compile the library with the support for the Timing app (needed by the
`Start Task` script):

```bash
./compile.sh -t Library
```

To compile the Duration script:
```bash
./compile.sh Duration
```

You can also see how to use the script `compile.sh` by running it with the -h
option:
```bash
./compile.sh -h
```

### Manually

You can also compile and install the scripts manually. Make sure that the
library script is installed first.

To do that, compile the file **omnifocuslib.applescript**.Then, copy the compiled file
**omnifocuslib.scpt** to the directory `~/Library/Script Libraries/`. The
Terminal commands to do that are 

```bash
osacompile -o Library/omnifocuslib.scpt Library/omnifocuslib.applescript
cp Library/omnifocuslib.scpt ~/Library/Script\ Libraries/
```

To install one of the OmniFocus scripts, compile the script
using `osacompile` and then copy it to the OmniFocus 3 script directory. To see
what your script directory is, open OmniFocus 3 and navigate to `Menubar ->
Help -> Open Scripts Folder`. Typically, this directory is either

```
~/Library/Application Scripts/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3
``` 

or

```
~/Library/Application Scripts/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus3.MacAppStore
``` 

depending on how you purchased OmniFocus. 

### Configuration
There might be additional configuration steps. They are described either in a README of the script or in the next section of this README.

## Scripts

1. **[Sort Tags](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Sort%20Tags)**: 
Define categories of tags and their priorities. Then, you can use the script to
order your tags according to the priority of the category.

2. **[Defer](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Defer)**:
Defer all the selected tasks to tomorrow. This script can easily be modified to
defer all the selected tasks to _x_ days from today. Makes deferring much
quicker and can be done in batch.

3. **[Edit Links](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Edit%20Links)**:
Edit displayed name of all links in notes of all selected tasks or projects.
Useful if you often add links to your notes and do not want to manually edit
their displayed name one by one.

4. **[Duration](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Duration)**:
Simple script that calculates the total duration of all selected tasks. This is
useful when you have a project and want to quickly see what is the estimated
duration. I also use this to see how long will it take to complete the tasks I
scheduled for today. The script defaults to 15 minutes when duration is not set
in OmniFocus. This can be changed in the `duration.applescript` file: change
the argument of `getDuration` handle on line 6.

5. **[Start Task](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Start%20Task)**:
This is a quite complex script. It is for those people that are using the
**Timing** app to track what they have done. This script takes the selected
task in OmniFocus and checks if the project or action group the task belongs to
is in **Timing**. If not, it then offers to add this project to **Timing**: It
dutifully asks you for the parent project this new project should belong to,
the color of the new project, and finally the productivity score of the
project. The script also starts the **Focus** app if it is installed on your
computer. This app blocks distracting websites and apps. 
_Note: you need to have compiled the `timinglibrary` by running the script
`compile.sh` with the -t option (see above)._

6. **[Next to Front](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Next%20to%20Front)**:
This script adds the _Forecast Tag_ as the primary tag of all selected actions.
I wrote this because on iOS you can often only see 1 tag per action and it is
important for me to see whether the action is tagged with the _Forecast Tag_.
My forecast tag is "ðŸ—„Next", if you are using a different forecast tag (which
is almost certainly the case), change the variable `nextName` in
`nexttofront.applescript`.

## Icons

To use the Scripts in OmniFocus, one typically adds a button for that script in
the toolbar. OmniFocus uses the script's Finder icon for the script button. If
you are using more than 1 script it can be difficult to distinquish them.
Moreover, the default icon, in my opinion, looks boring. Hence, I have
converted some FontAwesome icon to the macOS `.icns` format. The icons can be
found in different colors using mostly the OmniFocus 3 dark color pallette. To
use them, open the location of a script in Finder and open the _Get Info_
window. Then, drag the `.icns` file to the script's icon in _Info_ window.

You can see my OmniFocus toolbar with those icons used here:

The icon files can be found [here](https://github.com/Rahlir/OmniFocusScripts/tree/master/Icons).

## Attribution

The icons are modified icons from the FontAwesome collection. The official
website can be found [here](https://fontawesome.com/). There is also a [Github
repository](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).
