# Edit Links

## How this works

This script lets you quickly edit displayed names of all links in notes of
selected tasks or projects. I have written this because I often paste links
into my tasks and editing their displayed name proved cumbersome. This script
massively speeds up the process by iterating over all links in the notes and
showing pop up dialog where you can edit the displayed name for each link.

## Installation

Just as described in the main README: use `osacompile` to compile and copy the
compiled script to the OmniFocus script library.
